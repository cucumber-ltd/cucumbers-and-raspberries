The radio boots up pre-loaded with a handful of our favourite stations. Pressing the button switches to the next station.

The radio has two features:

- [Start and stop the radio](https://app.cucumber.pro/projects/cucumbers-and-raspberries/documents/branch/master/features/start_and_stop.feature)
- [Change stations](https://app.cucumber.pro/projects/cucumbers-and-raspberries/documents/branch/master/features/change_stations.feature)
