# Raspbery Pi Radio - Built with Cucumber!

At Christmas, my lovely wife asked for a radio that had "one button". She likes simplicity.

So, inspired by [this guide](http://www.suppertime.co.uk/blogmywiki/piradio/) my 8-year old and I got a Raspberry Pi and a couple of other bits, and built this:

The radio boots up pre-loaded with a handful of our favourite stations. Pressing the button switches to the next station.

The radio has two features:

- [Start and stop the radio](https://app.cucumber.pro/projects/cucumbers-and-raspberries/documents/branch/master/features/start_and_stop.feature)
- [Change stations](https://app.cucumber.pro/projects/cucumbers-and-raspberries/documents/branch/master/features/change_stations.feature)
