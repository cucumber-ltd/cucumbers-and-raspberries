# cucumbers-and-raspberries

At Christmas, my lovely wife asked for a radio that had "one button". She likes simplicity.

So, inspired by [this guide](http://www.suppertime.co.uk/blogmywiki/piradio/) my 8-year old and I got a Raspberry Pi and a couple of other bits, and built this:

The radio boots up pre-loaded with a handful of our favourite stations. Pressing the button switches to the next station.

Now it turns out the code for this radio is quite interesting, if we use it as an excuse to play with the [ports and adapters](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture) pattern for structuring your application.

We have a [training workbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JbmuuHuktgHBQFnDzmxEVkCqI4PEZYJaNfPBPc6QM8Q/edit?usp=sharing) that we use for running a workshop with this code and a room full of Raspberry Pis. [contact us](mailto:sales@cucumber.io) if you'd like us to run a workshop at your company.
